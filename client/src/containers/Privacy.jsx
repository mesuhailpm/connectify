            <p className="mb-4">
                We collect information to provide better services to all our users â€“ from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads youâ€™ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Review and update your Google activity controls to decide what types of data you would like saved with your account when you use Google services.</li>
                <li>Review and control certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.</li>
                <li>View and edit your preferences about the Google ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings.</li>
